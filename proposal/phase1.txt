Subject: Phase 1 - Brazdil: Taint-Based Flow Tracing through Bytecode Instrumentation on Android

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name:                      David Brazdil

College:                   Trinity Hall

User Identifier:           db538

Director of Studies:       Dr Simon Moore

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

Given Android's growing popularity and openness, it became 
a frequent target of malware, which encourages researchers 
to propose different approaches to increasing the platform's 
protection mechanisms. Borrowing the idea of dynamic taint-
based information-flow analysis from TaintDroid, my project 
will trace sensitive data during runtime and pinpoint places 
where they leave the application, allowing users to check 
how their data are used. This will be done by automatic 
instrumentation of the executable code, which is different 
from the virtual-machine modification approach taken in the 
original paper. Based on other work done in this area, I 
will experiment with implicit-flow tracing and performance 
optimisation.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

Dr Alastair Beresford

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's PWF and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the PWF.
If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

Own computer with Android SDK
Own Android smartphone for testing
