\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the Makefile.  It should
explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
document on both CUS and Thor.

\section{Dalvik Virtual Machine}

Dalvik is an open-source virtual machine and an essential component of the Android operating system. It was developed specifically for use on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and its design was optimised for running on battery-powered systems with low-performance processor and limited memory. 

Built around the Apache Harmony project, Dalvik runs programs that are compatible with a subset of the Java runtime framework. However, unlike the stack-based JVM, Dalvik uses a register-based architecture. Applications for Dalvik are therefore typically written in Java, compiled to a set of JVM bytecode \textit{.class} files, and then converted to a single Dalvik-compatible \textit{.dex} file using tools in the Android SDK. Thanks to Dalvik's JIT compiler, applications for Android run almost natively while staying independent of the underlying architecture.

\subsection{Application Package Files}

Applications for Android are distributed in Application Package files (APK). These are ZIP files signed by the publisher, which contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item the executable \textbf{classes.dex} file
\item application resources (images, UI layouts, ...)
\item native code binaries
\item manifest
\end{itemize}

The compulsory manifest file contains essential information about the application to the operating system. Among other things, this includes its unique package name, list of permissions requested by the application, and a list of all its entry points.
